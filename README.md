# TechTV Downloader Bash script

Download all videos from a TechTV collection.

This has only been tested on Mac OS X Yosemite.

Download all files listed in videos.rss. You can download a collection's videos.rss file by right-clicking the "RSS" link from any TechTV collection and selecting "Download Linked File".

    $ ./techtv.sh videos.rss
    
Test mode. Display how files would be downloaded and named but don't download any video.

    $ ./techtv.sh -t videos.rss
    
Only attempt to download original source files.

    $ ./techtv.sh -o videos.rss
    
Only attempt to download files that are missing originals but were transcoded to stream.

    $ ./techtv.sh -b videos.rss

This script visits every page in a TechTV collection and check if the original video file is available. If there is no original file, it will download the basic.mp4 file, which is what plays in the browser window when you visit the webpage yourself.

This script then saves each video in the same directory as the script file, giving it the title from the web page and appropriate file extension. If there are any characters in the title of the video that wouldn't be safe for filenames, those characters are converted to underscores.
